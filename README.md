This project is a Web Visualization tool for sorting algorithms.

## About
This project was made to have a greater and indepth understanding of Sorting Algorithms by visualising them and analysing things deeply.
Because one learns more from watching than reading.

## Usage
Visit the site at https://sort-algo-visualizer.netlify.app/

## Significance of different colours in visualization:

1: Yellow=> Signifies which element we are currently looking.

2: Red=> Signifies that we are changing the element.

3: Blue=> Signifies that element is on hold.

4: Green=> Signifies that element is in final sorted position.
