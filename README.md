# Sorting_Visualizer

This project is a Web Visualization tool for sorting algorithms.

When you click on certain algorithm, it starts visualizing the sorting algorithm in a beautiful way.

Significance of different colours in visualization:

1: Yellow=> Signifies which element we are currently looking.

2: Red=> Signifies that we are changing the element.

3: Blue=> Signifies that element is on hold.

4: Green=> Signifies that element is in final sorted position.
